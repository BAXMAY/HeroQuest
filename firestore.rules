/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for Deeds & Cheers application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for both user profiles and volunteer work submissions. Users can only access and modify data associated with their own user ID.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User profiles are stored under `/users/{userId}`, ensuring each profile is directly associated with a specific user.
 * - Volunteer work submissions are stored under `/users/{userId}/volunteer_work/{workId}`, creating a user-specific subcollection for managing submissions.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Listing all users is disallowed.
 * - Data validation is relaxed to allow rapid prototyping. However, ownership and relational integrity are strictly enforced.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `VolunteerWork` documents have a `userProfileId` that MUST match the `userId` in the path. This enforces ownership without requiring additional `get()` calls.
