/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for Deeds & Cheers application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all user-related data. Users can only access and modify data associated with their own user ID. Admins have elevated privileges to review submissions.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User profiles are stored under `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Volunteer work submissions are under `/users/{userId}/volunteer_work/{workId}`.
 * - Achievements are under `/users/{userId}/achievements/{achievementId}`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Listing all users is disallowed for non-admins.
 * - Data validation is relaxed for rapid prototyping, but ownership and relational integrity are strictly enforced.
 * - Admins can read all volunteer work submissions for approval purposes.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `VolunteerWork` documents have a `userProfileId` that MUST match the `userId` in the path. This enforces ownership without requiring additional `get()` calls.
